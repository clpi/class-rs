### Command Line Argsistence

- `04/27/22 02:01` Currently branching this off of the start of another project I'm working on, so the library will take some time to fully take shape, but the ultimate purpose of this project is to fill the gap in the Rust comand-line arg-parsing ecosystem, specifically for those looking for a library that is well-maintained, with a zippy build-time, producing miniscule binaries, without putting unncessary complexity on the table or sacrificing too many of the comforts provided by the more weighty options currently available.


### Notes
- `04/27/22 02:09` I hope the intro isn't too exciting because I've still got a long way to go, well, you can see for yourself. This has been a project that I have focused much of my auiliary thought upon for the last several months, so momomntum and growth shall not be far off.
